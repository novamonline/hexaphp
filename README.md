# HexaPHP
HexaPHP is a PHP framework that follows the hexagonal architecture pattern. It is designed to make it easy to build maintainable and scalable PHP applications, by providing a simple and consistent structure for organizing code and separating concerns.

## Features
- *Modular architecture*: HexaPHP is organized into separate applications and libraries, each with its own set of dependencies and responsibilities.
- *Hexagonal architecture*: Each application in HexaPHP is built using the hexagonal architecture pattern, which emphasizes separation of concerns and modularity.
- *Docker-based development and deployment*: HexaPHP uses Docker for development and deployment, making it easy to package and deploy applications to a production environment.
- *Monorepo architecture*: HexaPHP is managed as a single codebase, making it easy to share code and manage dependencies across multiple applications and libraries.
